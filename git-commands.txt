git init - git initialize
git help some-command - gives help about that command
git status - provides current status of the current repository

Staging area - local env where files are present. Git gives option to include whichever files we want to push from staging area

git add file.txt - stage the file to be pushed to the VCS

git commit -a - commit all changes (not add new ones)

git commit :/ - add everything from the top (not clear enough)

git log - visualise the version history

git log --all --graph --decorate - shows the version history into a graph, easier to visualise

git checkout hash-of-commit - used to go to particular commit in the VCS

git checkout file.txt - discards all changes done to the file and reverts it back to the state it was in the commit pointed by HEAD (last commit)

git diff file.txt- shows the differences in file.txt compared to the previous command. It can also take in an argument, which is the hash of any commit throughout the version history, and compare changes with that commit.
git diff 48889d6 file.txt - here the changes are compared with the commit containing the given hash.
git diff 48889d6 HEAD file.txt - compares file differences between 2 commits
git diff 48889d6 HEAD - compares everything between 2 commits

git branch branchname - creates new branch

git checkout branchname - change to the given branch

git checkout -b branchname - create a new branch and change to it (combine the above 2 commands)

git merge branchname - merges a branch with the main branch

git mergetool - a tool which can be used to resolve merge conflicts. Popularly uses vimdiff as the editor.

git merge --continue - after merge conflicts are resolved, continue the merge

git merge --abort - stop the merge process

git remote - lists all remote repositories that git is aware for this directory

git remote add <remotename> <remotelocation> - add a remote repository
ex: git remote add origin ../remote

git push <remotename> <local branchname>:<remote branchname> - push changes from local repo to remote. Can push whichever branch is needed, and the branch receiving it at the remote can also be given a new name.
ex: git push origin main:main

git fetch <remotename> - fetches commits from remote repo

git merge - combines commits which were fetched from the remote repo and merges them with the local repo

git pull - same as git fetch; git merge

git clone <remotelocation> <localrepo> - clone a remote repo to local machine
